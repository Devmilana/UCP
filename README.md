## Assignments  

### **Assignment 1**  
An **ASCII-based obstacle avoidance game** where the player moves across a **dynamically allocated 2D array**, avoiding moving obstacles and reaching the goal to win. Utilises a **pre-written random number generator** and **terminal behaviour configuration** for the game.  

### **Assignment 2**  
An **ASCII-based game** that loads a **map from a text file**. The map provides a pathway for a **moving car obstacle** which the player must navigate while avoiding the car to reach the goal. Utilises a **generic linked list** and **struct** to track **player movement** and **car location** for an "undo" feature.
